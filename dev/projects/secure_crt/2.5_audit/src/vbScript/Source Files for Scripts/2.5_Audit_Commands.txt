# This is a generic commands file. Comments are supported
# if they exist on a line that begins with a '#' character.
# The comment character can be changed in the script code
# if on some platform a command you need to send actually
# begins with a '#' character. Edit the scipt code file
# (usually named RunCommandsOnMultipleHostsAndLogResults)
# and modify the g_strComment variable to reflect your
# desired comment sequence.
